   libvirt Builder
   ================

The libvirt-builder package provides an API to bind together the
libvirt-designer and libvirt-gobject APIs, to actually automate some
of the lifecycle management and VM provisioning tasks.

Installation
------------

The libvirt-builder package uses GNU autotools, so the build install
process follows the standard process documented in the INSTALL file.
As a quick start you can do

  ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc \
        --localstatedir=/var --libdir=/usr/lib
  make
  sudo make install

Or to install into a private user specific location

  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/libvirt-builder
  make
  make install

The following mandatory dependencies are required in order to
build libvirt-builder

  libvirt-gconfig  >= @LIBVIRT_GCONFIG_REQUIRED@ (part of libvirt-glib project releases)
  libosinfo        >= @LIBOSINFO_REQUIRED@


Communication
-------------

To communicate with the development team, or to post patches
there is a technical mailing list:

   https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/libvir-list

End user support can be found at

   https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/libvirt-users

There is also a mailing list for new release announcements:

  https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/libvirt-announce

Bugs found when using an OS distribution's binary packages should
be reported to the OS vendors' own bug tracker first.
